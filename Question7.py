# 7. Take an integer A as input. You have to print the sum of all odd numbers in the range [1,
# A].
# Input:- A= 4
# Output:- 4
# Explanation:- For A = 4, Odd numbers 1 and 3 lie in the range [1, 4]. Sum = 1 + 3 = 4.


num = int(input("enter a number : "))
odd = 0
for i in range(1,num+1):
    if(i%2!=0):
        odd = odd + i
print(odd)
